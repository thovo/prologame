## Board Representation
I- UI represenation:
  1. Board drawing
  2. Computer Move (show)
  3. Player Move:
    - User Input: (X,Y) for the next move
  3. Show the score for 2 players
    
II- Code representation:
  1. Game board will be represented as list of lists (rows are the inner lists, and columns are the elements)
  2. Weight matrix which will be filled depending on the heuristic
  3. Variables to store players scores

## Main Game Loop (Choice of heuristic given as parameter)
  #Variables:
  Computer_score = 0
  Human_score = 0
  #Functions calls
  1. Game over function
    - Check if the number of turn equal to N*N
      -- If so, game over, show_score.
    - gameover(Turns)
  2. Select the next move for AI, then calculate score
    - select_move(Board_matrix, AI_move) %Note: AI move is a list [X,Y]
    - update_board(Board_matrix, AI_move, New_board)
    - update_score(Board_matrix, AI_move, Computer_score) % This function will update the computer score.
    - show_score (human_score, Computer_score)
  3. Add the user move and update Game board, then calculate score
    - update_board(Board_matrix, Human_move, New_board)
    - update_score(Board_matrix, Human_move, Human_score) % This function will update the Human score.
    - show_score (human_score, Computer_score)

# Utilities functions - Omar
  get_row(matrix, cell, row) %Will return the row list of this cell
  get_col(matrix, cell, col) %Will return the col list of this cell
  get_diag1(matrix, cell, diag1) %Will return the forward diagonal list of this cell
  get_diag2(matrix, cell, diag2) %Will return the backward diagonal list of this cell
  scoring(dimension_list, score) %will take a row, col, diag1 or diag2, and return its score

## AI Strategies (Heuristics)
  1. Compute the "sum" at each turn for each cell, then fill the weights matrix with the sums
  2. Compute the "sum" at each turn for each cell, then fill the weights depending on the levels of sum (1 has low, 2 has very low, ...)
  3. Compute the "sum" at each turn for each cell,  then fill the weights depending on the levels of sum (1 has low, 2 has very low, ...). The weights of the lower 3 sum levels (1,2,3), and 3 higher sum levels (4.5.6) will change dynamically (or maybe with fixed steps) as the game turns advance.
